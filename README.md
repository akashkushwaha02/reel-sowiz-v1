# Instagram Reel feature

Reels Feed: Users will be presented with a feed of short video clips, similar to the standard Instagram Reels interface. The feed should display videos in a scrollable manner, allowing users to easily browse through them.

User Interaction: Users should be able to interact with the interface by liking, commenting, and sharing the reels. The standard Instagram Reels functionality for user interactions should be preserved.

Filter: On the basis of categories added by user,feeds will be filtered
